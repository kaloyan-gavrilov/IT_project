            The Porsche 911 Turbo, internally known as the 930, was developed in the 1970s to comply with FIA
            homologation regulations for Group 4 competition. Porsche needed to produce 400 cars within a
            twenty-four-month period to gain approval for Group 4, and the 911 Turbo quickly became popular among car
            enthusiasts. The car utilized a single KKK turbocharger and had a total power output of 260 PS at 5,500 rpm
            and 329 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. The platform also had a revised suspension, larger brakes, a stronger
            gearbox, and a "whale tail" rear spoiler for increased downforce.

            However, the car was demanding to drive, prone to oversteer and turbo-lag, and was nicknamed "the
            Widowmaker" due to several crashes and deaths attributed to its handling characteristics. Porsche made
            changes to the 930 for the 1978 model year, including enlarging the engine bore, adding an air-to-air
            intercooler, and upgrading the brakes to units similar to those used on the 917 race car. While the changes
            increased power output and torque, they also increased the weight of the vehicle, contributing to a
            substantial change in the handling and character of the car compared to earlier models. The 930 was
            eventually withdrawn from markets in Japan and the United States due to changing emissions regulations.
